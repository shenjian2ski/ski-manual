# DB SKI TRAINING OUTLINE

**Basic Level (The Austrian System):** 

**Prerequisite:** The clients should have an interest in skiing and be willing to try. Having little to no skiing experience is not a problem.

*Ski outfit suggestions*: [*ski outfit suggestion*](../doc/outfit_suggestion.md)

## Training Objectives:

- 🎯 Schussing (5%)
- 🎯 Snowplough (wedge position) (5%)
- 🎯 Snowplough Turns (15%)
- 🎯 Using Lifts (5%)
- 🎯 Edging -- Traversing (5%)
- 🎯 Sliding (5%)
- 🎯 Snowplough Steering (40%) 
- 🎯 Parallel Turning (20%)

## 1. Intro

## 2. Basic Concepts

-  **Safety Awareness:**
    - Always keep an eye on the uphill when doing the big traverse.
    - Watch out for those who don't control their speed and keep a safe distance from them (Black list)

-  **Equipments Set:**
    
    - Ski boots
    - Skis

- **Middle Position (Central Position):**

  - Explanation:
    - Hip-width stance
    - Slightly bent ankles, knees, and hips
    - Poles and arms positioned as if reading a newspaper

- **Outside Ski vs. Downhill Ski** 

## 3. Putting Concepts into Practice:

### 3.1 Schussing:
   🎯 Have fun!
   
   ⛷️ **Steps:**

   - Explain the __middle position__
   - Even Jump!

### 3.1 Snowplough (wedge position):
   🎯 Gliding and braking

   ⛷️ **Steps:**

   </p>
   
   - Start schussing and make a snowplough in the run out
   - Switch between parallel and snowplough
   - Brake in snowplough

### 3.2 Snowplough Turns:
   🎯 Skiing with change of direction


   
   ⛷️ **Steps:**
    <table>
    <tr>
        <td align="center">
        <img src="../doc/01_basic/snowplough_01.png" alt="snowplough_01">
        </td>
        <td align="center">
        <img src="../doc/01_basic/snowplough_02.png" alt="snowplough_02">
        </td>
        <td align="center">

        </td>
    </tr>
    </table>

   - Increasing pressure by bending ankles, knees and hips
   - Turning with the snowplough with variation of rhythm, radius and speed
   - Using an up and forward motion 
   - Ski tips drift into the fall line -> the weight shifts to the outside ski

### 3.3 Using Lifts:
   🎯 For longer ascents, it's necessary to use other forms of lifts
   

### 3.4 Edging -- Traversing:

   🎯 Skiing on the uphill edges in the "Alpine Basic Position" (ABP). 
    
   ⛷️ **Steps:**

   - Skis are parallel (hip wide)
   - Slightly bent ankles, knees, and hips
   - Advance your uphill ski, hip, arm, and shoulder open to the valley (lean your upper body slightly forward-downard)
   - Put more weight on your downhill ski and pressure the inner ski edges
   - Poles and arms positioned as if reading a newspaper

   
### 3.5 Sliding:
   🎯 Edging, sliding, speed regulation and stopping
   
   ⛷️ **Steps:** 
   
   - Through controlled flattening of the skis they release the edges and start sliding downhill

### 3.6 Snowplough Steering:

   🎯 Turning in the wedge with steering on uphill edges (parallel steering)
   

   
   ⛷️ **Steps:**

   - Start in basic alpine position on a traverse.
   - Simultaneously move upward, forward and stem out the uphill ski into a middle position
   - In the fall line the weight shifts to the outside ski (which then becomes the downhill ski) and matches the inside ski (which then becomes the uphill ski) and get return to ABP.   
   - Complete the turn while "steering" your skis parallel.
        
   📌 **Key Points:**

   - Inside ski (should not catch an edge)

   📋 **Exercise:** 

   - Fan progression

### 3.7 Parallel Turning:

   🎯 Simultaneously changing edges and turning skis. 

   ⛷️ **Steps:**

   - Start in basic alpine position on a traverse.
   - Simultaneously move upward, forward, and inward.
   - "__Drift into the fall line__." 
   - Change edges and build pressure with a __downward motion__.
   - Traverse again.

   📌 **Key Points:**
   - Drift into the fall line

## 4. Common Mistakes:

   - 🚫 Back seat skiing
   - 🔄 Rotation
   - ❌ X-legs
